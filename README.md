## Developer Comment
When I first received my living wage from my parents, I had no idea how to manage this money -- I did not have any financial goal or money-saving plan. This led me to have no idea of every purchase I made and the balance I had left. I started to check my debit card's spending history, but the myriad of information coming at me made it take me a full hour to figure out what had happened. *"Why not create my virtual bookkeeping on my phone to record all real-time transactions by myself?"* This is when my interest in PBS first started to emerge.

 I believe I am not the only one who has faced this dilemma when first living on my own and eagerly looking for a tool to keep track of personal financial transactions. Thus, the idea of building PBS came into my mind to offer simple and easy-to-follow features that allow everyone to manage complex financial data efficiently. **In my perspective, personal budgeting applies to everyone, regardless of age, profession, or other background.** Realizing that PBS could be used by individuals from all walks of life makes it a widely applicable project and greatly excites me to make a tangible difference in everyone's life by helping them achieve financial stability, meet saving goals, and obtain a clearer understanding of their spending habits.
